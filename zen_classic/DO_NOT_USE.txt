IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

  If you are developing a new theme based off of Zen, do NOT use the Zen Classic
  theme as a starting point. There are known issues with it that have been fixed
  in the main Zen theme.

ABOUT ZEN CLASSIC

  The Zen Classic theme contains the old stylesheets from Zen 5.x-0.7. It was
  made a sub-theme of Zen because, while the theme looked good as-is, everyone
  was tired of undoing all that CSS when using it to develop a new theme. See
  http://groups.drupal.org/node/6353 and http://drupal.org/node/171464

SUPPORT

  The Zen Classic theme is left as-is for historical purposes and as a reference
  for people who used Zen 5.x-0.7 and earlier.

  Support for the theme is minimal.
