IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

  If you are developing a new theme based off of Zen, do NOT use the Zen Classic
  theme as a starting point. There are known issues with it and you will not get
  any support.

ABOUT ZEN CLASSIC

  The Zen Classic theme contains the old Zen CSS (before 5.x-0.7) and was made a
  sub-theme of Zen because, while the theme looked good as-is, everyone was
  tired of undoing all that CSS when using it to develop a new theme.

SUPPORT

  The Zen Classic theme is left as-is for historical purposes and as a reference
  for people who used Zen before 5.x-0.7 was released.

  It is no longer supported.
